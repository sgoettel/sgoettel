### Hi there!

I am a digital humanist with a focus on structured data, digital text processing and the modeling of complex information systems. Besides my work in digital editions, I increasingly shifted towards information governance and security-related topics.

I am building into ISO/IEC 27001, BSI IT-Grundschutz, risk management and the procedural aspects of information security in public-sector environments.

My research interests — historical lexicography, cultural and intellectual history, Jewish-German scholarship — remain part of my work and hobbies; still with particular attention to the work and reception of [Daniel Sanders](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Sanders_(Lexikograf)). But they coexist with a growing focus on how organizations structure, secure and preserve information in the present.

I enjoy working on open source projects and data, regularly developing smaller tools – some more, some less useful. However, due to the nature of open source and certain other factors, it is not always possible for me to keep everything up to date or continuously maintain all of my projects.

If you wish to contact me, feel free to send an **[email](./img/mail.png)**.
