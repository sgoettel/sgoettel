### Hi there!

I am a linguist and digital humanist with a strong interest in lexical semantics and sociolinguistic phenomena. My research focuses on various topics, including the work of [Daniel Sanders](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Sanders_(Lexikograf)), the intellectual and modern history of 18th- and 19th-century Europe, and the digital transformation of historical documents and data. I am also deeply interested in the history of Jewish-German scholarship and other related areas.

I enjoy working on open source projects and data, regularly developing smaller tools â€“ some more, some less useful. However, due to the nature of open source and certain other factors, it is not always possible for me to keep everything up to date or continuously maintain all of my projects.
